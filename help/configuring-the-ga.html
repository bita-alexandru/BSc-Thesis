			<p>The Genetic Algorithm can be configured by tweaking the following values:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Population Size</i></li>
				The number of chromosomes that will make up the algorithm. The more, the better but at the cost of time performance.
				<li><i>Mutation Probability</i></li>
				The probability that a chromosome's gene will be modified. Usually set on a very small value.
				<li><i>Crossover Probability</i></li>
				The probability that a chromosome will get selected for crossover (as in exchanging information with another chromosome).
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Generation Fitness Multiplier</i></li>
				The multiplier to the generation count reached by a chromosome. The higher, the more important this is to the fitness function.
				<li><i>Population Fitness Multiplier</i></li>
				The multiplier to the average population count reached by a chromosome. The higher, the more important this is to the fitness function.
				<li><i>Initial Size Fitness Multiplier</i></li>
				The multiplier to the initial population size of a chromosome. The higher, the more important this is to the fitness function.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Population Target</i></li>
				The population size that a chromosome is supposed to stop running the algorithm once it reaches this value.
				<li><i>Generation Target</i></li>
				The generation count that a chromosome is supposed to stop running the algorithm once it reaches this value.
				<li><i>Epochs Target</i></li>
				The epoch count that the algorithm is supposed to stop running once it reaches this value.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Selection Method</i></li>
				The method of selecting the chromosomes for the following generation (as in the survival of the fittest).<br/>
				There are 6 selection methods to choose from:
				<ol>
					<li><i>Roulette Wheel Selection</i></li>
					A stochastic selection method, where the selection probability of a chromosome is proportional to its fitness.
					<li><i>Rank Selection</i></li>
					Ranks each chromosome by their fitness and makes the selection based on that rank, and not on their fitness.
					<li><i>Steady State Selection</i></li>
					As opposed to replacing the parents with their off-springs, this selection method replaces random chromosomes with the said off-springs.
					<li><i>Tournament Selection</i>, (using 3-way tournaments)</li>
					Groups of 3 randomly chosen chromosomes are made and the most fit chromosomes get selected for the next generation.
					<li><i>Elitism Selection</i>, (using 2 elites)</li>
					At the end of a generation, the 2 most fit chromosomes are being kept and will not suffer any changes from mutations or crossovers.
					<li><i>Random Selection</i></li>
					Randomly selects chromosomes for the next generation.
				</ol>
			</ul>
			
			The <b>fitness function</b> is represented by:<br/>
			<code>f(nOfGenerations, avgPopulation, initialSize) = 1 + (GFM*nOfGenerations + PFM*avgPopulation) * (1 - ISFM*initialSize/N)</code>,<br/>
			where <code>GFM</code> means <code>Generation Fitness Multiplier</code>, <code>PFM</code> means <code>Population Fitness Multiplier</code>, <code>ISFM</code> means <code>Initial Size Fitness Multiplier</code> and <code>N</code> means the total number of cells in the grid
